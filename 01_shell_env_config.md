## Basic concept
**vim:** ~/.vimrc: configure of vim; ~/.vim: data, plugins

**zsh:** ~/.zshrc: configure of zsh; ~/.oh_my_zsh: data, plugins

## Configure shell
This tutor is for mac/linux.

### Install
download the config file from github
 
``` git
git clone https://github.com/mayu95/env_config.git
```

install oh-my-zsh (also need on linux)
> **wget** is used to download files from website given a url. If wget is not existed, "brew install wget".

```shell
sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)"
```

run the config file (if there is update, ``` git pull ``` first)

``` shell
sh set_env.sh
```

if on linux, add below codes in 
```
~/.bash_profile
```

```
zsh -l
```

restart shell
> load config for iTerm2:
> 
> * **com.googlecode.iterm2.plist:** config of item2, e.g., cursor shape
> * **NeoDark.itemcolors:** color theme: preference -> profile -> color -> color presets -> import -> select NeoDark
> * **text setting:** text -> text rendering
> * **transparency:** profiles -> window -> transparency


### Note
If **gdircolors** can not be installed, you should "brew install coreutils" on your mac. (This problem will not show on linux.)
